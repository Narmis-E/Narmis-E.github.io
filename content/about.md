# About Me

+ 👋 I'm **Narmis**.
+ 🎓 Student and avid desktop ricer. Not much of a programer, I don't re-invent the wheel when somebody has made a script for it already 🏴‍☠️.

# Now

*[what is this](https://nownownow.com/about)*

+ **Now**, I am focused on nothing at all.

+ In my free time, you can find me 🍙 ricing, laughing at the latest memes on r/ProgrammerHumour (and r/Linuxmemes) and listening to daft punk 🤖.
