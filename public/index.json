Inspired by Eric Murphy\u0026rsquo;s fascinating Article. I have carefully selected the tools and configurations that suit my needs and enhance my productivity.\nYou can explore my (messy) Dotfiles here. It\u0026rsquo;s a repository where I store and share my configuration files for various applications and Bash Scripts. Feel free to check it out! 👀🔧\nLinux Distribution and Desktop Environment 🐧 Among the various Linux distributions available, my personal choice is Manjaro Linux! It may have received some criticism from the Linux community, but in my opinion, it\u0026rsquo;s the only distribution that really hits the spot for me. 🎯👌 I\u0026rsquo;ve tried Ubuntu, Pop!_OS, ArcoLinux, Linux Mint, and even ventured into Arch Linux territory, but Manjaro 🐧 stands out as the perfect fit for my needs and preferences. 🌟\n🖥️ When it comes to my desktop environment, I have found my perfect match in KDE! 🌈✨ With its feature-rich and customizable interface, KDE has become my go-to choice for a visually appealing and efficient desktop experience. 🖱️💻 Whether it\u0026rsquo;s the sleek design, extensive customization options, or the seamless integration of applications, KDE has won me over completely. 💙🐧 It\u0026rsquo;s the perfect environment for unleashing my productivity while enjoying a delightful user interface. 😊🚀\nWeb browsing For my web browser, I use Firefox with some custom configurations. Occasionally, I also use Brave Browser. 😑 While Brave is decent, it tends to be a bit bloated. Here are the browser extensions I rely on: uBlock Origin: This handy extension efficiently blocks ads and trackers, ensuring a cleaner and more private browsing experience. Vimium: With Vim-like keybindings, this extension allows me to navigate web pages using keyboard shortcuts, improving my browsing speed and productivity. Bitwarden: For managing my passwords securely, I rely on Bitwarden. This extension simplifies the process of storing and autofilling passwords, keeping my online accounts protected. These browser extensions complement my browsing experience and help me maintain security and convenience while navigating the web. 🌐🔒\nPersonal Development Environment (PDE) I rely on Neovim as my Personal Development Environment (PDE). ⌨️😊 Despite Vim\u0026rsquo;s notorious steep learning curve, I firmly believe that the journey is worth the ultimate rewards. 🚀💪\nAdditionally, I also use VSCode with Vim keybindings.\nTerminal \u0026amp; Tools I rely on the terminal file manager lf for its impressive speed, customization capabilities, and support for image previews using a custom script. For GUI file management, I turn to Dolphin, a versatile file manager that offers a user-friendly graphical interface. 🖥️📂\nI use Alacritty as my terminal emulator, along with Zsh as my shell and Tmux as a terminal multiplexer. 🔥💻⚡\nferdium\nMedia Player and Configuration I rely on MPV as my go-to media player, enhanced with a convenient yt-dlp hook, allowing seamless playback and stream youtube videos without hesitation 🎥🎵. You can found my MPV-Config in here. I\u0026rsquo;ve added the following alias to my .zshrc file to easily listen to YouTube videos:\nytmusic=\u0026#34;mpv --vo=null --video=no --pause=no --no-video --term-osd-bar --loop-playlist=inf \u0026#34; This alias allows me to enjoy YouTube without interruptions, using the $ ytmusic \u0026lt;YouTube Url\u0026gt; . 🎵🎧\nTheme, Font, and Color Scheme I embrace the Tokyonight color scheme for all my applications, including this website\u0026rsquo;s Dark Mode. When it comes to my terminal font, I opt for JetBrains Mono, specifically the Nerd Font version, ensuring a stylish and pleasant coding experience. 🎨🖥️✨\nThis Website This site is built with Hugo, a static site generator that outputs clean HTML and CSS, avoiding the bloat commonly found in modern web development. This website utilizes the PaperMod Theme with some customizations. Hosting for this site is provided by GitHub Pages.
